## General info

It is a simple application for organizing your notes.<br />
The main goal was to create a simple solution with high-quality code, using all the frameworks / libraries / etc listed at the top.<br /><br />

There are two main views: one for all notes and one for all categories.<br />
You can add new notes, edit or delete existing ones from the notes view.<br />
You can assign zero or more categories to each note.<br />
Categories can be added from the category view.<br />
You can sort notes alphabetically or search for notes that interest you.<br />

## Opening the project

Go to appsettings.json in project, then fill "user id" and "password" for "DefaultConnection" if you want to use database.<br />
You can run application from your IDE or use Docker.<br />
